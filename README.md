An implementation of *OpenAlchemist* by *Guillaume "Keph" Delhumeau* and
*Antoine "guigoz" Morineau* using graphics based on OpenAlchemist, made for the
GameBoy, by *usr_share* on OpenGameArt. Created using the *Rednex Gameboy
Development System*.


__This is a learning project for me to become more familiar with writing
assembly. Do not expect excellent or bug-free code in this project.__


## Notes
* My logo has been omitted from this project in `data/zaid.2bpp` and
`data/zaid.tilemap`. These files are empty. Feel free to replace them with
your own logo.

An implementation of OpenAlchemist by Guillaume "Keph" Delhumeau and
Antoine "guigoz" Morineau using graphics based on OpenAlchemist, made for the
GameBoy, by usr_share on OpenGameArt.

__This is a learning project for me to become more familiar with writing
assembly. Do not expect excellent or bug-free code in this project.__

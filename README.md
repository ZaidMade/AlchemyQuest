An implementation of *OpenAlchemist* by *Guillaume "Keph" Delhumeau* and
*Antoine "guigoz" Morineau* using graphics based on OpenAlchemist, made for the
GameBoy, by *usr_share* on OpenGameArt. Created using the *Rednex Gameboy
Development System*.


__This is a learning project for me to become more familiar with writing
assembly. Do not expect excellent or bug-free code in this project.__


## Notes
* My logo has been omitted from this code labeled 'Logo' INCBIN `zaid.2bpp` and
`zaid.tilemap` in ROM0's "Data" section in `src/data.asm`.
Feel free to replace it with your own.
